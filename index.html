          I am currently a postdoc in the department of Prof. Eberhard Bodenschatz at the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization in GÃ¶ttingen, Germany. My expertise is in the experimental study of large-scale unsteady and turbulent flows and I am broadly interested in problems relevant for energy, sustainability and climate. <b>I was recently awarded a Minerva Fast Track Position by the Max Planck Society. This fellowship allows me to start a small research group in my current department, which will focus on Turbulence and Wind Energy.</b> If you are interested in joining my group, please reach out to me!
          <br>

          <p>My current research interests include:
          <br>
          - Wakes and turbine-turbine interactions in wind farms
          <br>
          - Unsteady aerodynamics of wind turbine blades
          <br>
          - Novel sensing technologies for atmospheric turbulence
          <br>
          - Techno-economic modeling and public acceptance of wind energy</p>

          <p>I completed my PhD degree in May 2022 in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Princeton University, where I was advised by Prof. Marcus Hultmark. My doctoral research focused on unsteady aerodynamics with applications for wind turbines. This work was funded by a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship. During my PhD, I was awarded a fellowship from the High Meadows Environmental Institute to study the future role of onshore and offshore wind energy in the US at the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs. In the future, I will continue to supplement my engineering research with studies of relevant policy questions.</p>
