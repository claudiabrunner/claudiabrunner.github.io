        <p>Here we explain which data we record when you visit our website and how exactly they are used:
        </p>
          <h2>Provision of the Website</h2>
          <p>
          1. Type of data<br>
          Each time you visit our website, our service and applications automatically record data and information from the computer system of the visiting computer.<br>

          The following data are gathered temporarily:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your IP address</li>
          <li>Date and time of your access to the website</li>
          <li>Address of the page visited</li>
          <li>Address of the previously visited website (referrer)</li>
          <li>Name and version of your browser / operating system (if transmitted)</li>
        </ul>
          <p>These data are stored in our systems' log files. There is no storage of these data together with other personal data relating to the users.</p>

          <p>
          2. Legal basis<br>

          The legal basis for the temporary saving of data and log files is Article 6 (1) lit. f GDPR. Storage occurs in log files in order to ensure the website's functionality. The data also serve to optimize the websites, eliminate malfunctions and ensure our IT system security. Our justified interest in data processing pursuant to Article 6 (1) lit. f GDPR also lies in such purposes.
          The recording of data for the provision of the website and the storage of data in log files are essential to operate the website. It is therefore not possible for the users to object.
        </p>

        <p>
          3. Data deletion<br>

          The data are deleted as soon as they are no longer required in order to fulfil the purpose of their collection. If data are gathered for the provision of the website, this is the case if the respective visit is ended. In the event that data are stored in log files, this is the case after seven days at the latest. Storage above and beyond this period is possible. In this case, the users' IP addresses are deleted or removed so they can no longer be allocated to the visiting client.
        </p>
