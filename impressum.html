        <h2>Liability for Contents of Online Information</h2>
        As the provider of contents in accordance with Section 7 Paragraph 1 of the Tele-Media Law, the website provider shall be responsible for any contents which is made available for use in accordance with general legal provisions. The provider makes every effort to provide timely and accurate information on this website. Nevertheless, errors and inaccuracies cannot be completely ruled out. Therefore, the provider does not assume any liability for the relevance, accuracy, completeness or quality of the information provided. The provider shall not be liable for damage of a tangible or intangible nature caused directly or indirectly through the use or failure to use the information offered and/or through the use of faulty or incomplete information unless it is verifiably culpable of intent or gross negligence. The same shall apply to any downloadable software available free of charge.

          <h2>Links to Websites of Third Parties</h2>
            This website includes links to external pages. These external links are designated as follows: <img src="images/external_link_icon.svg" alt="external link icon" class="symbol-image">. The respective provider shall be responsible for the contents of any linked external pages. In establishing the initial link, the provider of this website has reviewed the respective external content in order to determine whether such link entailed possible civil or criminal responsibility. However, a constant review of linked external pages is unreasonable without concrete reason to believe that a violation of the law may be involved. If the provider determines such or it is pointed out by others that an external offer to which it is connected via a link entails civil or criminal responsibility, then the provider will immediately eliminate any link to this offer. The provider expressly dissociates itself from such contents.
